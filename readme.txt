Backgammon

This game of backgammon may be played between mutliple human players on the same computers, between two different computers running this program, or can be played between or against an AI. 
The most interesting part of this to write was the AI, of which I created 3, then pitted them against each other to determine the best player. I tried many different heuristics to improve their performance. I particularly enjoyed the process of coming up with various ideas, then implementing them to try and figure out what strategies worked and which didn't. 
Another interesting part of this particular project was the networking protocols, figuring out how to have the game communicate with other computers, to make sure both games would have a consistent board and a consistent idea of the winner.
